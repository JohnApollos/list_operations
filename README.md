# Python List Operations Demo

This repository contains a simple Python script (`list_operations.py`) that demonstrates common operations on Python lists. It's a great quick reference for understanding how to manipulate list data structures.

## Operations Demonstrated

The script performs the following sequence of operations on a list:

1.  **Initialization:** Creates an empty list.
2.  **Appending Elements:** Adds individual elements to the end of the list using `append()`.
3.  **Inserting Elements:** Inserts an element at a specific position using `insert()`.
4.  **Extending List:** Adds all elements from another iterable (like another list) to the end of the current list using `extend()`.
5.  **Removing Last Element:** Removes and returns the last element of the list using `pop()`.
6.  **Sorting:** Sorts the list in ascending order in-place using `sort()`.
7.  **Finding Index:** Locates and prints the index of a specific element using `index()`.

## How to Run

1.  **Prerequisites:** Ensure you have Python 3 installed on your system.
2.  **Save the file:** Save the provided Python code as `list_operations.py`.
3.  **Open a terminal/command prompt:** Navigate to the directory where you saved the file.
4.  **Execute the script:**
    ```bash
    python list_operations.py
    ```
